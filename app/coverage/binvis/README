Example showing how to get covergroup parents in the design.  Each
covergroup shape ("variant") has a covdbParent relation that can be
followed to a covdbSourceDefinition module handle.  These links are
enabled when the following configuration is set:

    covdb_qualified_configure(des, covdbShowGroupsInDesign, "1");

Once this is done, from a covergroup variant handle a program can
follow the covdbParent relation to get the variant's design parent:

    while((var = covdb_scan(vars))) {
        covdbHandle defParent = covdb_get_handle(var, covdbParent);
        ...
    }

Use make all_cg to run it on a VDB with only functional
coverage data and no design information dumped

To run the example:
	Use Makefile
