This is a simple UCAPI example that will dump out all leaf-level
toggle coverage objects for a specified module. Dumped data is found in
file dump_tgl

Since this is a UCAPI program, you will need to compile it against
your own VCS_HOME installation to use it.  To create the executable,
just type "gmake" in this directory.

To run the example:
	Use Makefile
